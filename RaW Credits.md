## Permissions and asset usage:

If you intend to use ANY and we stress the word ANY asset from this mod, be it a sound file, skin, particle, model, map, prop, lua, xml, icon, graphic file, animation, etc. Then this guide will explain all this. 
If you wish to use any of the above in your mod the below credit file for the corresponding item must be used in your credits. 
If you plan to use a specific model then the corresponding model credit line must be used exactly as it appears here. 
If this is done properly then you do not need permission to use anything in this mod. If this is not done as exactly prescribed as above then you do NOT have permission to use any of the above items.
If you wish to **edit** one of the above items that includes **improve**, **change**, **correct**, **alter**, or any other word you can think of for changing something you still must include the credit file exactly as it appears.  After that you may add what you did to change the item.

Below are examples of our credit and a acceptable credit line for someone who has changed a item.

```
ModelFile: Mesh- z3r0x |Animation- z3r0x |Skin- z3r0x | Rigging- z3r0x   --GOOD
```

This is a perfect example. Next a credit line for someone who changed something. 

```
ModelFile: Mesh-z3r0x | Animation- z3r0x |Skin- z3r0x | Rigging- z3r0x | Low poly mesh edits- EAWmodmaker dude
```
 
Above is a perfect example of someone who has made some changes to a item. Now we used models as examples but this will apply to any of the items in the mod. 
If you agree to all this then you may use anything you wish with no permission needed and no PMs or emails telling us it will be in your mod etc. It goes a long way to be honest, so please provide credit the proper way. 
You would be amazed at how well things would go when proper and *CORRECT* credit is given to authors.  

Thanks 

Republic at War Modding Team
