# Magnaguard

Commissioned after the InterGalactic Banking Clan refused to hire Grievous's Kaleesh elite after securing his own services as an enforcer, and he demanded a cadre of "more intelligent battle droids" to serve him. The MagnaGuards proved to be formidable, being able to take on Jedi and clone troopers with ease, and were regarded as being even worse than droidekas by some.
