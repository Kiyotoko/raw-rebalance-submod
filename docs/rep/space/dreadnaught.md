# Dreadnaught

The heavy cruisers of the Dreadnaught-class were built for the Galactic Republic already decades ago by Rendili StarDrive and were with their length of 600 meters among the most powerful vesseks of the Judicial forces. With the creation of the GAR they were integrated into the centralized navy and fulfill now support roles. Heavily armored and with a good mix of Turbolasers and Lasercannons they can tackle a multitude of tasks despite their advanced age.
